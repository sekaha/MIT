"""
    all state machines share these few common abilities:
    start, step, and transduce

    a transducer is defined by the following:

    a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a set of states
    a next state function, n(i,s) -> s+
    an output function, o(i,s) -> o+
    an initial state s0
